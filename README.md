# Towards Real-Time Sign Language Recognition on Edge Devices: A Comparative Evaluation

This page contains all of the required source code to replicate the experiments conducted in the paper titled: Towards Real-Time Sign Language Recognition on Edge Devices: A Comparative Evaluation, by Angela Trpcheska, Filip Zevnik, and Sebastian Bader.

## Structure
The mbnv1, 2, and 3 folders contain the models generated during the research. The firmware folder contains the STM32 CubeIDE project firmware for the DISCO board. Lastly, the train_and_eval_notebook.ipynb notebook contains the Python code to generate, train, and evaluate the models. The dataset used is also available as a .ZIP file.
